# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a version control system created by Linus Torvalds to assist in the development of the Linux OS. It's taken over as the industry standard from an older system called Subversion. Git's main advantage is that it's decentralized, meaning it doesn't need a single server for people to work off of. It's decentralized nature is why GitHub exists. Anyone can push thier changes up to GitHub and allow anyone else to contribute to thier projects. GitHub is the cloud service that runs Git.

  Researched answer: Basically the same thing I wrote above. Git is the software and GitHub is the cloud service.



2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:  Any type of evaluation which asks if something is true or false.  

  Researched answer: An 'if' statement will return a Boolean value. Any evaluation that inherently asks if something is true or false will return a Boolean value of either 'true' or 'false'.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is an entire array. A value is each individual element in an array.

  Researched answer: When referring to arrays, a value is each individual element separated by a comma. The index is the particular location of the value within the array. If your array is ["dogs", "cats", "snakes"], then the index of "snakes" is 2, and the value is "snakes".



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: A piece of code that performs a specific action that's built into a programming language to make it easier for the user.

  Researched answer: Javascript built-in methods are actions that can be performed by attaching them to "objects" (we havent covered objects yet, but I don't know how else to phrase it). One helpful sentence I read stated "A property is what an object has, while a method is what an object does". This helped clear up some confusion around '.length' and why it's referred to in the sylabus as a 'property' and not a 'method'.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming is used to streamline development by having two people work on the same code together. It allows for faster problem solving. The proper way to do pair programming is having a 'driver' and a 'navigator'. The driver is the one who types out the code, and the navigator is the one who talks it out and tells the driver what to type. 

  Researched answer: "Pair programming is when two people write code together on one machine". This is a nice concise way of putting it. It allows for fewer mistakes or bugs coming out of the gate, which means the code quality is going to be alot better for each sprint (and might result in fewer sprints and development time).



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: I found the lectures extremely helpful. A structured learning environment helps immensely, as oppossed to trying to learn on my own when I have time.  It also provides a safe space to ask any question without feeling like I'm asking a stupid question.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: Each time you loop through a piece of code.

2. Higher Order Functions: A function is similar to a method where it's a block of code that performa a specific action. I'm guessing that a "higher order" function is a built-in function that takes precedance and would be executed before anything else.

3. Jest: A Javascript testing platform

4. Objects: A snippet of code with multiple different properties and values.

5. Classes: Similar to a function, but with more lines of code.
